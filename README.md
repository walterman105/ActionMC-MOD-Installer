# ActionMC-MOD-Installer
An installer for Velleda's ActionMC Mod!

This is an auto installer for Velleda's ActionMC Mod (https://github.com/notvelleda/actionmc-mod/)

Installer only works on Linux! (for now)
  Hoping to add a macOS version soon! Windows version might come, but Velleda's own installer should be out by then.


# How to use?
Download it from here https://github.com/walterman105/ActionMC-MOD-Installer/releases
Open up the Minecraft launcher of your choice and download Minecraft 1.2.5 (tested with Mineshafter & TLauncher).
Unzip the file and run mod.sh!
It should install and you can choose ActioMC from yor list of Minecraft versions.
